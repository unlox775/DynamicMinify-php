==  Minimal Install  ==

===  Install Generate Handler Script  ===

For basic usage, a good approach is to make a /dyn-js/ folder in your document root.

Place the following in /dyn-js/dynamic-minify.php
<pre>
<?php
require_once('/path/to/DynamicMinify.php');

$config = array(
	'encapsulation_mode' => 'minify',
	'minified_store_path' => '/tmp/dynamic-minify-cache', // absolute, or relative to DOC-ROOT
	'cache_hook' => null,
	);
$dyn_minify = new DynamicMinify($_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT'], $config);

$dyn_minify->serveCollection($_SERVER['REDIRECT_URL']);
</pre>


===  .htaccess Rule ===

To route all calls through the PHP for /dyn-js/
<pre>
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} ^/dyn-js/
RewriteRule (.*) dyn-js/dynamic-minify.php [L]
</pre>


===  Make your first minified-set in a JSON file  ===

To serve the file /dyn-js/common.js

Edit for example, /dyn-js/common.js.json:
<pre>
{
	"combined_files": [
		"/lib/jquery.min.js",
		"/js/menu.js",
		"/js/carousel.js"
		]
}
</pre>

All files listed must be absolute paths from the docroot.


===  Ready to serve  ===

Now, it is ready to serve the files merged into one.

This file should now come up, and have a valid Source Map: /dyn-js/common.js

However, it is only concatenated together, not yet minified.  See below.


==  Install Background Minifier Job  ==

This background job is designed to be able to re-index multiple developer's sandboxes on a single shared server.  The below example is possibly more than you will need for a single site.

Define this regen-config JSON file and save it somewhere:
<pre>
{
    "config": {
        "encapsulation_mode":"minify",
        "minified_store_path": "/tmp/dynamic-minify-cache"
    },
    "scan_paths": [
        "/dyn-css",
        "/dyn-js"
    ],
    "platforms": {
        "production": "/shared/accounts/k/kansascitysteaks/production/kansascitysteaks/sites/www",
        "beta": "/shared/accounts/k/kansascitysteaks/beta/kansascitysteaks/sites/www",
        "dave": "/shared/accounts/k/kansascitysteaks/dave/kansascitysteaks/sites/www",
        "tom": "/shared/accounts/k/kansascitysteaks/tom/kansascitysteaks/sites/www"
    }
}
</pre>

Install a line like this in your crontab:
<pre>
*/15 * * * * /usr/bin/php /path/to/DynamicMinify/bin/regenerate-minified-content.php /path/to/regen-config.json -q
</pre>
